# Overview

A Website I built for Grupo Acad√©mico Seistetos. This was my first website and the one where I consolidated my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills. I later rebuilt this using Vue3 as a SPA which enabled me to produce a much more readable and mantainable codebase

## Acknowledgments

A special thanks to Mirti for having the patience of hearing me rambling about all the silly bugs I found during the development of my this project and to all the group members who sent me their picture and information, definetly helped on giving the members page a bit more life.
